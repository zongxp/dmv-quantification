# DMV quantification

#### 介绍
Quantification of deep medullary vein diameters from gradient echo phase and magnitude images. 
The MATLAB function "DMV_diameter_measurement/DMV_Diameter.m" is the main function for the diameter measurement of deep medullary veins, the corresponding parameter settings are explained in the comments of the function. A simple demo is provided in "DMV_diameter_measurement/demo.m".
For the DMV segmentation model, please read "Segmentation_module/README.txt".

The method is published in MRM and included in the library.
